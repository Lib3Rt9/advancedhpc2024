\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Definition}

    A Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles...
    
    \subsection{Usage}

    After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.
    
    
\section{Implementation}

    \subsection{Introduction to CUDA}

        Compute Unified Device Architecture \\
        • A C/C++ SDK to accelerate algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs1 \\
        • A SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread) model \\
        • SIMD combinded with multithreading \\
        • First released in 2006 \\
